  - Development/production environment handling

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Code splitting with SplitChunks plugin
  - Vendor chunking for better caching
  - React library separation for optimal loading
  - Content hashing for cache busting

- **Development Experience**:
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
  - Source maps for debugging
  - Path aliases for cleaner imports (@components, @store, @utils, @types)
  - Auto-opening browser

### Build Configuration Highlights
```javascript
// webpack.config.js key features:
- Custom rules for SVGs, images, and fonts
- Environment variable injection

## üîÑ State Management

### Redux Toolkit + Redux-Saga Implementation

**Store Configuration**:
- Centralized state management with Redux Toolkit
- Saga middleware for handling async operations
- Type-safe selectors and actions

**Song Management Flow**:
1. Component dispatches action (e.g., `fetchSongs`)
2. Saga intercepts action and handles API call
3. Saga dispatches success/failure actions
4. Reducer updates state immutably
5. Components re-render with new data

**Key Sagas**:
- `fetchSongsSaga`: Handles song retrieval with pagination/filtering
- `createSongSaga`: Manages song creation with optimistic updates
- `updateSongSaga`: Handles song modifications
- `deleteSongSaga`: Manages song deletion

## üé® Design System & Theming

### Emotion + Styled System Implementation
- **Theme Provider**: Centralized theme configuration
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Complete theme switching capability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Color System**: Comprehensive color palette with semantic naming
- **Typography**: Consistent font weights and sizes
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system for consistent layouts

### Animation & Interactions
- **Framer Motion**: Page transitions, card animations, button interactions
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states, loading spinners, form feedback
- **Layout Animations**: Smooth transitions when adding/removing items

## üì° API & Data Management

### MirageJS Mock Server
The application uses MirageJS to simulate a realistic backend API:

**Available Endpoints**:
```
GET    /api/songs          # Fetch paginated songs with filters
GET    /api/songs/:id      # Fetch single song
POST   /api/songs          # Create new song
PUT    /api/songs/:id      # Update existing song
DELETE /api/songs/:id      # Delete song
GET    /api/genres         # Fetch available genres
```

**Features**:
- Realistic pagination with total counts
- Search functionality across multiple fields
- Genre filtering
- Sorting by multiple criteria
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

### API Integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API operations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates for better UX
- **Debounced Search**: Efficient search with 500ms delay

## üß™ Testing

### Test Setup
- **Jest**: Test runner with custom configuration
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with best practices
- **jsdom**: Browser environment simulation
- **Coverage**: Code coverage reporting

### Test Examples
```typescript
// Component testing with Redux
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import SongList from '@components/Songs/SongList';

// Tests include:
- Component rendering
- User interactions
